            <p>(worried) Well, that's a relief. (The police car takes off and passes Marty and Doc.) Let's go, I sure hope we find Jennifer before she finds herself! (He looks at a sign which gives information on the skyway. It says "Skewed on Skyway C25".) Damn, the skyway's jammed, it's going to take us forever to get there. (Almanac) And this stays here, I didn't invent the time machine to win at gambling, I invented the time machine to travel through time! I know, I know Doc! (Doc puts the almanac on a barrel and the two leave. Unknown to them, Biff has been overhearing! He opens a door to see the almanac and picks it up.)What? Oh, what I meant to day was… Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and you're my density. I mean, I'm your destiny. Oh.</p>

            <p>(Marty is asleep in a darkened bedroom. Suddenly he wakes up.) Mom...Mom, is that you? (with Irish accent) There there now, you've been asleep for nearly 6 hours now. I had this horrible nightmare. It was terrible. I dreamed I was in a western...I was being chased by Indians. And a bear. Well, you're safe and sound, here now at the McFly farm.Hold on Marty! (Cut to Biff’s point of view. He sees a flying futuristic car and a kid on a hovering board. He's so mesmerized he doesn't see the truck in front of him until it's too late.) Shit! (He crashes into it, and finds it's a manure truck!) Ha, ha, ha, yeah!</p>
